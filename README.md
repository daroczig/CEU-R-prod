* 13:30 - 15:10 session 1
* 15:10 - 15:40 break
* 15:40 - 17:20 session 2

## Location

In-person at the Vienna campus (QS B-421).

## Syllabus

Please find in the `syllabus` folder of this repository.

## Technical Prerequisites

1. You need a laptop with any operating system and stable Internet connection.
2. Please make sure that Internet/network firewall rules are not limiting your access to unusual ports (e.g. 22, 8787, 8080, 8000), as we will heavily use these in the class (can be a problem on a company network). CEU WiFi should have the related firewall rules applied for the class.
3. Please install Slack, and join the #﻿ba-de3-2023 channel in the `ceu-bizanalytics` group.
4. When joining remotely, it's highly suggested to get a second monitor where you can follow the online stream, and keep your main monitor for your own work. The second monitor could be an external screen attached to your laptop, e.g. a TV, monitor, projector, but if you don't have access to one, you may also use a tablet or phone to dial-in to the Zoom call.

## Class Schedule

Will be updated from week to week.

## Week 1

**Goal**: learn how to run and schedule R jobs in the cloud.

### Background: Example use-cases and why to use R in the cloud?

Excerpts from https://daroczig.github.io/talks

* "A Decade of Using R in Production" (Real Data Science USA - R meetup)
* "Getting Things Logged" (RStudio::conf 2020)
* "Analytics databases in a startup environment: beyond MySQL and Spark" (Budapest Data Forum 2018)

### Welcome to AWS!

1. Use the following sign-in URL to access the class AWS account: https://657609838022.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
2. Secure your access key(s), other credentials and any login information ...

    <details><summary>... because a truly wise person learns from the mistakes of others!</summary>

    > "When I woke up the next morning, I had four emails and a missed phone call from Amazon AWS - something about 140 servers running on my AWS account, mining Bitcoin"
    -- [Hoffman said](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots)

    > "Nevertheless, now I know that Bitcoin can be mined with SQL, which is priceless ;-)"
    -- [Uri Shaked](https://medium.com/@urish/thank-you-google-how-to-mine-bitcoin-on-googles-bigquery-1c8e17b04e62)

    So set up 2FA (go to IAM / Users / username / Security credentials / Assigned MFA device): https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam

    PS probably you do not really need to store any access keys, but you may rely on roles (and the Key Management Service, and the Secrets Manager and so on)
    </details>

3. Let's use the `eu-west-1` Ireland region

### Create and connect to an EC2 box

1. Create an EC2 instance

    0. Optional: create an Elastic IP for your box
    1. Go the the Instances overview at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Instances:sort=instanceId
    2. Click "Launch Instance"
    3. Provide a name for your server (e.g. `daroczig-de3-week1`) and some additional tags for resource tracking, including tagging downstream services, such as Instance and Volumes:
        * Class: `DE3`
        * Owner: `daroczig`
    4. Pick the `Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type` AMI
    5. Pick `t3a.small` (2 GiB of RAM should be enough for most tasks) instance type (see more [instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types))
    6. Select your AWS key created above and launch
    7. Pick a unique name for the security group after clicking "Edit" on the "Network settings"
    8. Click "Launch instance"
    9. Note and click on the instance id

2. Connect to the box

    1. Specify the hostname or IP address

    ![](hhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/putty-session-config.png)

    2. Specify the "Private key file for authentication" in the Connection category's SSH/Auth/Credentials pane
    3. Set the username to `ubuntu` on the Connection/Data tab
    4. Save the Session profile
    5. Click the "Open" button
    6. Accept & cache server's host key

Alternatively, you can connect via a standard SSH client on a Mac or Linux, something like:

```sh
chmod 0400 /path/to/your/pem
ssh -i /path/to/your/pem -p 8000 ubuntu@ip-address-of-your-machine
```

As a last resort, use "EC2 Instance Connect" from the EC2 dashboard by clicking "Connect" in the context menu of the instance (triggered by right click in the table).

### Install RStudio Server on EC2

1. Look at the docs: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server
2. First, we will upgrade the system to the most recent version of the already installed packages. Note, check on the concept of a package manager!

    Download Ubuntu `apt` package list:

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    ```

    Optionally upgrade the system:

    ```sh
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

    And optionally also reboot so that kernel upgrades can take effect.

3. Install R

    ```sh
    sudo apt install r-base
    ```

    To avoid manually answering "Yes" to the question to confirm installation, you can specify the `-y` flag:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y r-base
    ```


4. Try R

    ```sh
    R
    ```

    For example:

    ```r
    1 + 4
    hist(mtcars$hp)
    # duh, where is the plot?!
    ```

    Exit:

    ```r
    q()
    ```

    Look at the files:

    ```sh
    ls
    ls -latr
    ```


5. Install RStudio Server

    ```sh
    wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/jammy/amd64/rstudio-server-2023.12.1-402-amd64.deb
    sudo apt install -y gdebi-core
    sudo gdebi rstudio-server-2023.12.1-402-amd64.deb
    ```

6. Check process and open ports

    ```sh
    rstudio-server status
    sudo rstudio-server status
    sudo systemctl status rstudio-server
    sudo ps aux | grep rstudio

    sudo apt -y install net-tools
    sudo netstat -tapen | grep LIST
    sudo netstat -tapen
    ```

7. Look at the docs: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/

### Connect to the RStudio Server

1. Confirm that the service is up and running and the port is open

    ```console
    ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-150:~$ sudo netstat -tapen | grep LIST
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8787            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          49065       23587/rserver
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          15671       1305/sshd
    tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      0          15673       1305/sshd
    ```

2. Try to connect to the host from a browser on port 8787, eg http://foobar.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8787
3. Realize it's not working
4. Open up port 8787 in the security group, by selecting your security group and click "Edit inbound rules":

    ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/495736/222724348-869d0703-05f2-4ef3-bd80-574362e73265.png)

5. Authentication: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/authenticating-users.html
6. Create a new user:

        sudo adduser ceu

7. Login & quick demo:

    ```r
    1+2
    plot(mtcars)
    install.packages('fortunes')
    library(fortunes)
    fortune()
    fortune(200)
    system('whoami')
    ```

8. Reload webpage (F5), realize we continue where we left the browser :)
9. Demo the terminal:

    ```console
    $ whoami
    ceu
    $ sudo whoami
    ceu is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
    ```

8. Grant sudo access to the new user by going back to SSH with `root` access:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y mc
    sudo mc
    sudo mcedit /etc/sudoers
    sudo adduser ceu admin
    man adduser
    man deluser
    ```

Note 1: might need to relogin / restart RStudio / reload R / reload page .. to force a new shell login so that the updated group setting is applied
Note 2: you might want to add `NOPASSWD` to the `sudoers` file:

    ```sh
    ceu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    ```

Although also note (3) the related security risks.
