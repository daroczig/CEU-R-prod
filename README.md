2 x 3 x 100 mins on March 20 and 27:

* 13:30 - 15:10 session 1
* 15:10 - 15:40 break
* 15:40 - 17:20 session 2
* 17:20 - 17:40 break
* 17:40 - 19:20 session 3

## Location

In-person at the Vienna campus (QS B-421).

## Syllabus

Please find in the `syllabus` folder of this repository.

## Technical Prerequisites

1. You need a laptop with any operating system and stable Internet connection.
2. Please make sure that Internet/network firewall rules are not limiting your access to unusual ports (e.g. 22, 8787, 8080, 8000), as we will heavily use these in the class (can be a problem on a company network). CEU WiFi should have the related firewall rules applied for the class.
3. Please install Slack, and join the #ï»¿ba-de3-2023 channel in the `ceu-bizanalytics` group.
4. When joining remotely, it's highly suggested to get a second monitor where you can follow the online stream, and keep your main monitor for your own work. The second monitor could be an external screen attached to your laptop, e.g. a TV, monitor, projector, but if you don't have access to one, you may also use a tablet or phone to dial-in to the Zoom call.

## Class Schedule

Will be updated from week to week.

## Week 1

**Goal**: learn how to run and schedule R jobs in the cloud.

### Background: Example use-cases and why to use R in the cloud?

Excerpts from https://daroczig.github.io/talks

* "A Decade of Using R in Production" (Real Data Science USA - R meetup)
* "Getting Things Logged" (RStudio::conf 2020)
* "Analytics databases in a startup environment: beyond MySQL and Spark" (Budapest Data Forum 2018)

### Welcome to AWS!

1. Use the following sign-in URL to access the class AWS account: https://657609838022.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
2. Secure your access key(s), other credentials and any login information ...

    <details><summary>... because a truly wise person learns from the mistakes of others!</summary>

    > "When I woke up the next morning, I had four emails and a missed phone call from Amazon AWS - something about 140 servers running on my AWS account, mining Bitcoin"
    -- [Hoffman said](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots)

    > "Nevertheless, now I know that Bitcoin can be mined with SQL, which is priceless ;-)"
    -- [Uri Shaked](https://medium.com/@urish/thank-you-google-how-to-mine-bitcoin-on-googles-bigquery-1c8e17b04e62)

    So set up 2FA (go to IAM / Users / username / Security credentials / Assigned MFA device): https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam

    PS probably you do not really need to store any access keys, but you may rely on roles (and the Key Management Service, and the Secrets Manager and so on)
    </details>

3. Let's use the `eu-west-1` Ireland region

### Create and connect to an EC2 box

1. Create an EC2 instance

    0. Optional: create an Elastic IP for your box
    1. Go the the Instances overview at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Instances:sort=instanceId
    2. Click "Launch Instance"
    3. Provide a name for your server (e.g. `daroczig-de3-week1`) and some additional tags for resource tracking, including tagging downstream services, such as Instance and Volumes:
        * Class: `DE3`
        * Owner: `daroczig`
    4. Pick the `Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type` AMI
    5. Pick `t3a.small` (2 GiB of RAM should be enough for most tasks) instance type (see more [instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types))
    6. Select your AWS key created above and launch
    7. Pick a unique name for the security group after clicking "Edit" on the "Network settings"
    8. Click "Launch instance"
    9. Note and click on the instance id

2. Connect to the box

    1. Specify the hostname or IP address

    ![](hhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/putty-session-config.png)

    2. Specify the "Private key file for authentication" in the Connection category's SSH/Auth/Credentials pane
    3. Set the username to `ubuntu` on the Connection/Data tab
    4. Save the Session profile
    5. Click the "Open" button
    6. Accept & cache server's host key

Alternatively, you can connect via a standard SSH client on a Mac or Linux, something like:

```sh
chmod 0400 /path/to/your/pem
ssh -i /path/to/your/pem -p 8000 ubuntu@ip-address-of-your-machine
```

As a last resort, use "EC2 Instance Connect" from the EC2 dashboard by clicking "Connect" in the context menu of the instance (triggered by right click in the table).

### Install RStudio Server on EC2

1. Look at the docs: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server
2. First, we will upgrade the system to the most recent version of the already installed packages. Note, check on the concept of a package manager!

    Download Ubuntu `apt` package list:

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    ```

    Optionally upgrade the system:

    ```sh
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

    And optionally also reboot so that kernel upgrades can take effect.

3. Install R

    ```sh
    sudo apt install r-base
    ```

    To avoid manually answering "Yes" to the question to confirm installation, you can specify the `-y` flag:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y r-base
    ```


4. Try R

    ```sh
    R
    ```

    For example:

    ```r
    1 + 4
    hist(mtcars$hp)
    # duh, where is the plot?!
    ```

    Exit:

    ```r
    q()
    ```

    Look at the files:

    ```sh
    ls
    ls -latr
    ```


5. Install RStudio Server

    ```sh
    wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/jammy/amd64/rstudio-server-2023.12.1-402-amd64.deb
    sudo apt install -y gdebi-core
    sudo gdebi rstudio-server-2023.12.1-402-amd64.deb
    ```

6. Check process and open ports

    ```sh
    rstudio-server status
    sudo rstudio-server status
    sudo systemctl status rstudio-server
    sudo ps aux | grep rstudio

    sudo apt -y install net-tools
    sudo netstat -tapen | grep LIST
    sudo netstat -tapen
    ```

7. Look at the docs: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/

### Connect to the RStudio Server

1. Confirm that the service is up and running and the port is open

    ```console
    ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-150:~$ sudo netstat -tapen | grep LIST
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8787            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          49065       23587/rserver
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          15671       1305/sshd
    tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      0          15673       1305/sshd
    ```

2. Try to connect to the host from a browser on port 8787, eg http://foobar.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8787
3. Realize it's not working
4. Open up port 8787 in the security group, by selecting your security group and click "Edit inbound rules":

    ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/495736/222724348-869d0703-05f2-4ef3-bd80-574362e73265.png)

5. Authentication: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/authenticating-users.html
6. Create a new user:

        sudo adduser ceu

7. Login & quick demo:

    ```r
    1+2
    plot(mtcars)
    install.packages('fortunes')
    library(fortunes)
    fortune()
    fortune(200)
    system('whoami')
    ```

8. Reload webpage (F5), realize we continue where we left the browser :)
9. Demo the terminal:

    ```console
    $ whoami
    ceu
    $ sudo whoami
    ceu is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
    ```

8. Grant sudo access to the new user by going back to SSH with `root` access:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y mc
    sudo mc
    sudo mcedit /etc/sudoers
    sudo adduser ceu admin
    man adduser
    man deluser
    ```

Note 1: might need to relogin / restart RStudio / reload R / reload page .. to force a new shell login so that the updated group setting is applied
Note 2: you might want to add `NOPASSWD` to the `sudoers` file:

    ```sh
    ceu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    ```

Although also note (3) the related security risks.

9. Custom login page: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/authenticating-users.html#customizing-the-sign-in-page
10. Custom port (e.g. 80): http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/access-and-security.html#network-port-and-address

    ```sh
    echo "www-port=80" | sudo tee -a /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
    sudo rstudio-server restart

### Play with R for a bit

0. Note the pretty outdated R version ... so let's update R:

    ```sh
    wget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)-cran40/"

    ## fetch most recent list of packages and version, then auto-upgrade
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
    ```

    Now try R in the console, then restart R in RStudio (Session/Quit Session). Also a good time to clean up the Terminal (brush icon in the top right of the panel).

1. Installing packages:

    ```sh
    ## don't do this at this point!
    ## install.packages('ggplot2')
    ```

2. Use binary packages instead as per https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u

    ```sh
    wget -q -O- https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/assets/dirk_eddelbuettel_key.asc | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cranapt_key.asc
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://r2u.stat.illinois.edu/ubuntu jammy main"
    sudo apt update

    sudo apt-get install -y r-cran-ggplot2
    ```

    Note that all dependencies (let it be an R package or system/Ubuntu package) have been automatically resolved and installed.

    Don't forget to click on the brush icon to clean up your terminal output if needed.

    Optionally [enable `bspm`](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u#step-5-use-bspm-optional) to enable binary package installations via the traditional `install.packages` R function.

3. Ready to use it from R after restarting the session:

    ```r
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp)) + geom_histogram()
    ```

4. Get some real-time data and visualize it:

    1. Install the `devtools` R package and a few others (binary distribution) in the RStudio/Terminal:

        ```sh
        sudo apt-get install -y r-cran-devtools r-cran-data.table r-cran-httr r-cran-jsonlite r-cran-data.table r-cran-stringi r-cran-stringr r-cran-glue r-cran-logger r-cran-snakecase
        ```

    2. Switch back to the R console and install the `binancer` R package from GitHub to interact with crypto exchanges (note the extra dependency to be installed from CRAN, no need to update any already installed package):

        ```r
        devtools::install_github('daroczig/binancer', upgrade = FALSE)
        ```

    3. First steps with live data: load the `binancer` package and then use the `binance_klines` function to get the last 3 hours of Bitcoin price changes (in USD) with 1-minute granularity -- resulting in an object like:

        ```r
        > str(klines)
        Classes âdata.tableâ and 'data.frame':  180 obs. of  12 variables:
         $ open_time                   : POSIXct, format: "2020-03-08 20:09:00" "2020-03-08 20:10:00" "2020-03-08 20:11:00" "2020-03-08 20:12:00" ...
         $ open                        : num  8292 8298 8298 8299 8298 ...
         $ high                        : num  8299 8299 8299 8299 8299 ...
         $ low                         : num  8292 8297 8297 8298 8296 ...
         $ close                       : num  8298 8298 8299 8298 8299 ...
         $ volume                      : num  25.65 9.57 20.21 9.65 24.69 ...
         $ close_time                  : POSIXct, format: "2020-03-08 20:09:59" "2020-03-08 20:10:59" "2020-03-08 20:11:59" "2020-03-08 20:12:59" ...
         $ quote_asset_volume          : num  212759 79431 167677 80099 204883 ...
         $ trades                      : int  371 202 274 186 352 271 374 202 143 306 ...
         $ taker_buy_base_asset_volume : num  13.43 5.84 11.74 7.12 15.24 ...
         $ taker_buy_quote_asset_volume: num  111430 48448 97416 59071 126493 ...
         $ symbol                      : chr  "BTCUSDT" "BTCUSDT" "BTCUSDT" "BTCUSDT" ...
         - attr(*, ".internal.selfref")=<externalptr>
        ```

        <details><summary>Click here for the code generating the above ...</summary>

        ```r
        library(binancer)
        klines <- binance_klines('BTCUSDT', interval = '1m', limit = 60*3)
        str(klines)
        summary(klines$close)
        ```
        </details>

    4. Visualize the data, eg on a simple line chart:

        ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod/2019-2020/images/binancer-plot-1.png)

        <details><summary>Click here for the code generating the above ...</summary>

        ```r
        library(ggplot2)
        ggplot(klines, aes(close_time, close)) + geom_line()
        ```
        </details>

    5. Now create a candle chart, something like:

        ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod/2019-2020/images/binancer-plot-2.png)

        <details><summary>Click here for the code generating the above ...</summary>

        ```r
        library(scales)
        ggplot(klines, aes(open_time)) +
            geom_linerange(aes(ymin = open, ymax = close, color = close < open), size = 2) +
            geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = low, ymax = high), size = 0.25) +
            theme_bw() + theme('legend.position' = 'none') + xlab('') +
            ggtitle(paste('Last Updated:', Sys.time())) +
            scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) +
            scale_color_manual(values = c('#1a9850', '#d73027')) # RdYlGn
        ```
        </details>

    6. Compare prices of 4 currencies (eg BTC, ETH, BNB and XRP) in the past 24 hours on 15 mins intervals:

        ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod/2019-2020/images/binancer-plot-3.png)

        <details><summary>Click here for the code generating the above ...</summary>

        ```r
        library(data.table)
        klines <- rbindlist(lapply(
            c('BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'BNBUSDT', 'XRPUSDT'),
            binance_klines,
            interval = '15m', limit = 4*24))
        ggplot(klines, aes(open_time)) +
            geom_linerange(aes(ymin = open, ymax = close, color = close < open), size = 2) +
            geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = low, ymax = high), size = 0.25) +
            theme_bw() + theme('legend.position' = 'none') + xlab('') +
            ggtitle(paste('Last Updated:', Sys.time())) +
            scale_color_manual(values = c('#1a9850', '#d73027')) +
            facet_wrap(~symbol, scales = 'free', nrow = 2)
        ```
        </details>



    7. Some further useful functions:

        - `binance_ticker_all_prices()`
        - `binance_coins_prices()`
        - `binance_credentials` and `binance_balances`

    8. Create an R script that reports and/or plots on some cryptocurrencies, ideas:

        - compute the (relative) change in prices of cryptocurrencies in the past 24 / 168 hours
        - go back in time 1 / 12 / 24 months and "invest" $1K in BTC and see the value today
        - write a bot buying and selling crypto on a virtual exchange

### Prepare to schedule R commands

![](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/download/attachments/2916393/fire-jenkins.svg)

1. Install Jenkins from the RStudio/Terminal: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y fontconfig openjdk-17-jre

    sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
      https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
      https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
      /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y jenkins

    sudo netstat -tapen | grep java
    ```

2. Open up port 8080 in the related security group
3. Access Jenkins from your browser and finish installation

    1. Read the initial admin password from RStudio/Terminal via

        ```sh
        sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
        ```

    2. Proceed with installing the suggested plugins
    3. Create your first user (eg `ceu`)

Note that if loading Jenkins after getting a new IP takes a lot of time, it might be due to
not be able to load the `theme.css` as trying to search for that on the previous IP (as per
Jenkins URL setting). To overcome this, wait 2 mins for the `theme.css` timeout, login, disable
the dark theme: https://github.com/jenkinsci/dark-theme-plugin/issues/458

### Schedule R commands

Let's schedule a Jenkins job to check on the Bitcoin prices every hour!

1. Log in to Jenkins using your instance's public IP address and port 8080
2. Use the `ceu` username and set a password (note this user is a virtual one, not the same as the user in shell)
3. Create a "New Item" (job):

    1. Enter the name of the job: `get current Bitcoin price`
    2. Pick "Freestyle project"
    3. Click "OK"
    4. Add a new "Execute shell" build step
    5. Enter the below command to look up the most recent BTC price

        ```sh
        R -e "library(binancer);binance_coins_prices()[symbol == 'BTC', usd]"
        ```

    6. Run the job

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod/2019-2020/images/jenkins-errors.png)

4. Debug & figure out what's the problem ...
5. Install R packages system wide from RStudio/Terminal (more on this later):

    Either start R in the terminal as the root user (via `sudo R`) and run the previous `devtools::install_github` command there, or with a one-liner:

    ```sh
    sudo Rscript -e "library(devtools);withr::with_libpaths(new = '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library', install_github('daroczig/binancer', upgrade = FALSE))"
    ```

6. Rerun the job

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod/2018-2019/images/jenkins-success.png)

7. Optionally set up E-mail and Slack notification for the job success/error:

    1. Scroll down in the job config to the "Post-build Actions" section
    2. Add "Editable email notification", then fill in the "Project Recipient List" with an email address, and click "Advanced Settings" to define the triggers (e.g. send email on success or failure, and if you want to attach anything to the email).
    3. Add "Slack notifications" and configure the triggers, all the other details (e.g. which Slack channel to report to and Slack username etc have been configured globally, so although you can override, but no need to).

### Schedule R scripts

1. Create an R script with the below content and save on the server, eg as `/home/ceu/bitcoin-price.R`:

    ```r
    library(binancer)
    prices <- binance_coins_prices()
    paste('The current Bitcoin price is', prices[symbol == 'BTC', usd])
    ```

2. Follow the steps from the [Schedule R commands](#schedule-r-commands) section to create a new Jenkins job, but instead of calling `R -e "..."` in shell step, reference the above R script using `Rscript` instead:

    ```shell
    Rscript /home/ceu/de3.R
    ```

    Alternatively, you could also install little R for this purpose:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install -y r-cran-littler
    r /home/ceu/de3.R
    ```

    Note the permission error, so let's add the `jenkins` user to the `ceu` group:

    ```shell
    sudo adduser jenkins ceu
    ```

    Then restart Jenkins from the RStudio Server terminal:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart jenkins
    ```

    A better solution will be later to commit our R script into a git repo, and make it part of the job to update from the repo.

3. Create an R script that generates a candlestick chart on the BTC prices from the past hour, saves as `btc.png` in the workspace, and update every 5 minutes!

    <details><summary>Example solution for the above ...</summary>

    ```r
    library(binancer)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(scales)
    klines <- binance_klines('BTCUSDT', interval = '1m', limit = 60)
    g <- ggplot(klines, aes(open_time)) +
            geom_linerange(aes(ymin = open, ymax = close, color = close < open), size = 2) +
            geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = low, ymax = high), size = 0.25) +
            theme_bw() + theme('legend.position' = 'none') + xlab('') +
            ggtitle(paste('Last Updated:', Sys.time())) +
            scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) +
            scale_color_manual(values = c('#1a9850', '#d73027'))
    ggsave('btc.png', plot = g, width = 10, height = 5)
    ```
    </details>

    1. Enter the name of the job: `Update BTC candlestick chart`
    2. Pick "Freestyle project"
    3. Click "OK"
    4. Add a new "Execute shell" build step
    5. Enter the below command to look up the most recent BTC price

        ```sh
        Rscript /home/ceu/plot.R
        ```
    6. Run the job
    7. Look at the workspace that can be accessed from the sidebar menu of the job.

## Week 2

7. The use of `sudo` and how to grant `root` (system administrator) privileges
8. Adding new Linux users, setting password, adding to group
9. Installing R packages system-wide VS in the user's home folder
10. Installing, setting up and first steps with Jenkins

Note that you do NOT need to do the instructions below marked with the :muscle: emoji -- those have been already done for you, and the related steps are only included below for documenting what has been done and demonstrated in the class.

### Amazon Machine Images

ðª Instead of starting from scratch, let's create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the EC2 node we used last week, so that we can use that as the basis of all the next steps:

* Find the EC2 node in the EC2 console
* Right click, then "Image and tempaltes" / "Create image"
* Name the AMI and click "Create image"
* It might take a few minutes to finish

Then you can use the newly created `de3` AMI to spin up a new instance for you:

1. Go the the Instances overview at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Instances:sort=instanceId
2. Click "Launch Instance"
3. Provide a name for your server (e.g. `daroczig-de3-week2`) and some additional tags for resource tracking, including tagging downstream services, such as Instance and Volumes:
    * Class: `DE3`
    * Owner: `daroczig`
4. Pick the `de3` AMI
5. Pick `t3a.medium` (4 GiB of RAM should be enough for most tasks) instance type (see more [instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types))
6. Select your AWS key created above and launch
7. Select the `de3` security group
8. click "Advanced details" and select `ceudataserver` IAM instance profile
9. Click "Launch instance"
10. Note and click on the instance id

### ðª Create a user for every member of the team

We'll export the list of IAM users from AWS and create a system user for everyone.

1. Attach a newly created IAM EC2 Role (let's call it `ceudataserver`) to the EC2 box and assign 'Read-only IAM access' (`IAMReadOnlyAccess`):

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod/master/images/ec2-new-role.png)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod/master/images/ec2-new-role-type.png)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod/master/images/ec2-new-role-rights.png)

2. Install AWS CLI tool:

    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install awscli
    ```

3. List all the IAM users: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/list-users.html

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

4. Export the list of users from R:

   ```
   library(jsonlite)
   users <- fromJSON(system('aws iam list-users', intern = TRUE))
   str(users)
   users[[1]]$UserName
   ```

5. Create a new system user on the box (for RStudio Server access) for every IAM user, set password and add to group:

   ```
   library(logger)
   library(glue)
   for (user in users[[1]]$UserName) {

     ## remove invalid character
     user <- sub('@.*', '', user)
     user <- sub('.', '_', user, fixed = TRUE)

     log_info('Creating {user}')
     system(glue("sudo adduser --disabled-password --quiet --gecos '' {user}"))

     log_info('Setting password for {user}')
     system(glue("echo '{user}:secretpass' | sudo chpasswd")) # note the single quotes + placement of sudo

     log_info('Adding {user} to sudo group')
     system(glue('sudo adduser {user} sudo'))

   }
   ```

Note, you may have to temporarily enable passwordless `sudo` for this user (if have not done already) :/

```
ceu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

Check users:

```
readLines('/etc/passwd')
```

### ðª Update Jenkins for shared usage

Update the security backend to use real Unix users for shared access (if users already created):

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/495736/224517493-652ac34e-f44d-4ac9-8d04-d661dcfc4c4b.png)

And allow `jenkins` to authenticate UNIX users and restart:

```sh
sudo adduser jenkins shadow
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```

Then make sure to test new user access in an incognito window to avoid closing yourself out :)

### ðª Set up an easy to remember IP address

Optionally you can associate a fixed IP address to your box:

1. Allocate a new Elastic IP address at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Addresses:
2. Name this resource by assigning a "Name" tag
3. Associate this Elastic IP with your stopped box, then start it

### ðª Set up an easy to remember domain name

Optionally you can associate a subdomain with your node, using the above created Elastic IP address:

1. Go to Route 53: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home
2. Go to Hosted Zones and click on `ceudata.net`
3. Create a new Record, where

    - fill in the desired `Name` (subdomain), eg `de3.ceudata.net`
    - paste the public IP address or hostname of your server in the `Value` field
    - click `Create`

4. Now you will be able to access your box using this custon (sub)domain, no need to remember IP addresses.

### ðª Configuring for standard ports

To avoid using ports like `8787` and `8080` (and get blocked by the firewall installed on the CEU WiFi), let's configure our services to listen on the standard 80 (HTTP) and potentially on the 443 (HTTPS) port as well, and serve RStudio on the `/rstudio`, and Jenkins on the `/jenkins` path.

For this end, we will use Nginx as a reverse-proxy, so let's install it first:

```shell
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

First, we need to edit the Nginx config to enable websockets for Shiny apps etc in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` under the `http` section:

```
  map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
      default upgrade;
      ''      close;
    }
```

Then we need to edit the main site's configuration at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` to act as a proxy, which also do some transformations, eg rewriting the URL (removing the `/rstudio` path) before hitting RStudio Server:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    rewrite ^/rstudio$ $scheme://$http_host/rstudio/ permanent;
    location /rstudio/ {
      rewrite ^/rstudio/(.*)$ /$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8787;
      proxy_redirect http://localhost:8787/ $scheme://$http_host/rstudio/;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_read_timeout 20d;
    }
}
```

And restart Nginx:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Find more information at https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552326-Running-RStudio-Server-with-a-Proxy.

Let's see if the port is open on the machine:

```shell
sudo netstat -tapen|grep LIST
```

Let's see if we can access RStudio Server on the new path:

```shell
curl localhost/rstudio
```

Now let's see from the outside world ... and realize that we need to open up port 80!

Now we need to tweak the config to support Jenkins as well, but the above Nginx rewrite hack will not work (see https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/reverse-proxy-configuration-troubleshooting/ for more details), so we will just make it a standard reverse-proxy, eg:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    rewrite ^/rstudio$ $scheme://$http_host/rstudio/ permanent;
    location / {

    }
    location /rstudio/ {
      rewrite ^/rstudio/(.*)$ /$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8787;
      proxy_redirect http://localhost:8787/ $scheme://$http_host/rstudio/;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_read_timeout 20d;
    }
    location ^~ /jenkins/ {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins/;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

And we also need to let Jenkins also know about the custom path, so uncomment `Environment="JENKINS_PREFIX=/jenkins"` in `/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service`, then reload the Systemd configs and restart Jenkins:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```

See more details at the [Jenkins reverse proxy guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/reverse-proxy-configuration-with-jenkins/reverse-proxy-configuration-nginx/).

Optionally, replace the default, system-wide `index.html` for folks visiting the root domain without either the `rstudio` or `jenkins` path (note that instead of the editing the file, which might be overwritten with package updates, it would be better to create a new HTML file and refer that from the Nginx configuration, but we will keep it simple and dirty for now):

```shell
echo "Welcome to DE3! Are you looking for <code>/rstudio</code> or <code>/jenkins</code>?" | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

Then restart Jenkins, and good to go!

It might be useful to also proxy port 8000 for future use via updating the Nginx config to:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    rewrite ^/rstudio$ $scheme://$http_host/rstudio/ permanent;
    location / {

    }
    location /rstudio/ {
      rewrite ^/rstudio/(.*)$ /$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8787;
      proxy_redirect http://localhost:8787/ $scheme://$http_host/rstudio/;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_read_timeout 20d;
    }
    location ^~ /jenkins/ {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins/;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
    location ^~ /8000/ {
      rewrite ^/8000/(.*)$ /$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

This way you can access the above services via the below URLs:

RStudio Server:

* http://your.ip.address:8787
* http://your.ip.address/rstudio

Jenkins:

* http://your.ip.address:8080/jenkins
* http://your.ip.address/jenkins

Port 8000:

* http://your.ip.address:8000
* http://your.ip.address/8000

If you cannot access RStudio Server on port 80, you might need to restart `nginx` as per above.

Next, set up SSL either with Nginx or placing an AWS Load Balancer in front of the EC2 node.
